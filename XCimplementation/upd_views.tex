%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  An issue to support automatic updatable views is determining if a statement is
  updating distribution key, which is not allowed in \XC.
  
  Code changed a bit to handle this in view update.
  
  When a statement is rewritten which updates an updatable view, the result may
  include all the columns including distribution column, which is not updating anyway.
  
  The change determines this more strictly to allow such case.
