\chapter{Preface}

\XC{} research and development work started in NTT DATA Corporation at around the year of 2002,
as RiTaDB, to achieve horizontally scalable database system based on shared-nothing architecture.

\XC{} implemented transparent global transaction management from the very beginning, but did not
have consistent updating capability for replicated tables.

After several years, RiTaDB was renamed to \XC{} as separate open source project derived from
the latest version of \PG.
Major achievements of \XC{} include horizontally-scalable PostgreSQL database cluster based on
shared-nothing architecture, global transaction management over the whole cluster,
table sharding and replication,
query planner and executor to utilize parallerizm among cluster nodes, and so on.

This book is a summary of the latest \XC{} implementation and its achievements.

  The rest of this part describes major implementation details of \XC.
  It is based upon the source code of \file{REL1_2_STABLE} branch of \XC{} git repository.

% Node extension (parser/planner): Koichi
\chapter{\label{chap:internalnodes}Node Structure for Parser and Planner}

  In \PG, internal information used in the parser, planner and executor is called \textbf{node}.
  \PG{} defined many internal nodes for specific use to share internal status or information among
  various internal modules.  
  
  This chapter describes additional node definition in \XC.
