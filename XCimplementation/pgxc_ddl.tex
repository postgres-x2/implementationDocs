  \file{pgxc_ddl} is \XC{} utility to propagate coordinator's catalog update to other nodes.
  
  Reference document will be found at
  \url{http://postgres-xc.sourceforge.net/docs/1_2_1/pgxcddl.html} and the code,
  it is a \file{bash} script in fact,
  is found at \file{src/contrib/pgxc_ddl}.
  
  
  
  \file{pgxc_ddl} was needed when \XC{} didn't propagate its DDL handling automatically,
  version 0.9 or earlier, and it is not needed at present releases later than 1.0.
